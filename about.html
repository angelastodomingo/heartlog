        heartlog is a student project made for university purposes.
        it's something that lets me create a site i want while also
        refining my dev skills at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        it's not a super original concept since there are countless
        journal / diary concepts already out there, so i thought i'd add
        in features that would improve its usability a little bit more,
        like the habit tracker and an art therapy section (which pulls
        some amazing pieces via the Art Institute of Chicago's API).
      </p>

        why those features? well, keeping track of your habits in everyday life helps improve your routine if you're struggling with it (like i am). or, you could also just use it as a reminder to do stuffâ€”like, i donâ€™t know, give your cat many pets or hit your recommended water intake for the day. i know i do that daily. and the art therapy section? well, sometimes, looking at art people made before you were born is weirdly therapeutic, and it definitely beats doom-scrolling (which i also struggle with).
      </p>
      <p>
        that's why i called it "art therapy"â€”it's like a detox from all those brain rot contents you see on social media nowadays and sorta heals your brain a bit. itâ€™s not a total fix for our fried attention spans or a cure for social media addiction, but heyâ€¦ it helps, even just a little.

      <p>
        but anyway, why would i choose to make this sorta site, you may ask (or not lol)? it's because i myself digitally journal daily, but there's always this fear in the back of my head that someone is reading all of my entries... so you know what? i could just create my own site where i, and only i, get to view my entries and no third party ever will (looking at you, google). i want that for you as well, since privacy is such a rarityâ€”especially nowadays with A.I. more present and prevalentâ€”so here's a space that's just yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        though yes, itâ€™s true the site requires an account to use it, i want you to know i donâ€™t actually have the power (or care, tbh) to view your data. what you write stays with you. i donâ€™t collect anything, and i never will.

      <p>
        the account systemâ€™s only there so you can switch users or log out quickly if someoneâ€™s snooping over your shoulder or whatever, i don't know. i built this for privacy, not surveillance.
      </p>
      <p>
        but iâ€™ll be real with you. technically, if i wanted to, i could take a peek at your entries. thatâ€™s just how backend storage works. but iâ€™d never do that, and i promise you i wonâ€™t. iâ€™ve got zero reason to. if that bugs you though, youâ€™re totally welcome to fork the project and self-host it. no hard feelings. just please donâ€™t take credit for the original, yeah? ðŸ’–
      </p>
      <p>
        i hope you enjoy my gift to you, dear user. use it well to get through challenges in your life, and best of luck to you.
